What is this?
-------------

I want to predict the popularity of programming languages. This is so I can make an informed decision about learning my
next programming language.

What does "popularity" mean for a programming language anyway?
--------------------------------------------------------------

That's a good question. Several possible answers are:

1. The number of programmers using the language, normalized by the number of programmers at that time.
2. The average salary of programmers using that language, or more generally a salary *distribution* over years of 
   experience (or something similar).
3. The number of programs (or lines of code) written in that language.

There may be others! Please share any you can think of.

Let's discuss these in more detail.
